This project analyzed the performance of college football players before and after transferring teams, focusing on changes in yards per game. Using R, the dataset was cleaned and prepared by ensuring key variables were numeric and removing missing values. Descriptive statistics, histograms, and boxplots were used to explore trends in performance before and after transfers. A paired t-test was conducted to evaluate whether the differences in performance were statistically significant, supported by normality checks using the Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Q plots. The analysis provided insights into the impact of transferring on player performance, highlighting potential trends and implications for player development and team strategies.
